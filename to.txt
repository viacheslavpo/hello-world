IBM XIV Interview Test - Files

Our company needs an infrastructure application (written in Java) that performs manipulations on lines of text stored in files. 

The application should run from a command line, perform a single manipulation action and then exit.
Three parameters are given to the application
1. Name of the text file that should be manipulated.
2. Name of the text file to throw the output of the manipulation to.
3. An action name to perform (i.e. "reverse" which should reverse all lines of the specified text file)
This application is an infrastructure!
The application users are developers that add their own new actions to the application without changing the application code. 
Your tasks:
1. Provide a top level design of the application
2. Write the implementation of the application and the implementation of one of the actions:
a. Sort – sorting the file rows (alphabetically) 
b. Shuffle – randomly shuffles the file rows
c. Reverse – reversing the order of the file rows
3. You may give additional requirements to the user that is adding his/her actions. Try to make it easy as possible to add new actions in both code and requirements. Keep it simple.
a. Remember, your user is a developer that wants to concentrate on his/her business logic only.
4. Handle exceptions
